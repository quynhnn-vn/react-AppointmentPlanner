# React Project: Appointment Planner
Use stateful and stateless functional React components with Hook to create an app that manages contacts and appointments.
The app consists of two pages:
- Contacts: view and add contacts
- Appointments: view and add appointments.

### Available Scripts

Run `npm install` inside the project's root directory (make sure you have Node installed on your computer)

Run `npm start` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Open [https://appointment-planner-qnn.netlify.app/](https://appointment-planner-qnn.netlify.app/) to view it in deployed version.

React Router will automatically redirect to: https://appointment-planner-qnn.netlify.app/contacts
